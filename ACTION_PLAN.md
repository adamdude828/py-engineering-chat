# Action Plan for Enhancing General-Agent with Long-Term Memory and Context Management

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

1. **Set up persistent storage**
   - Implement SQLite database for storing conversation histories
   - Create schema for conversations, summaries, and key insights
   - Develop basic CRUD operations for the database

2. **Implement basic conversation summarization**
   - Create a weak model for summarizing conversations
   - Implement background process for periodic summarization
   - Store summaries in the database

3. **Develop tiered context management system**
   - Implement recent, medium-term, and long-term memory tiers
   - Create logic for moving context between tiers
   - Integrate tiered system with the general-agent

## Phase 2: Context Optimization

4. **Implement dynamic context pruning**
   - Develop a lightweight model for scoring context relevance
   - Create a system for continuous evaluation of context
   - Implement pruning logic based on relevance scores

5. **Create selective context inclusion mechanism**
   - Implement embedding-based similarity search for context
   - Develop logic for selecting most relevant context pieces
   - Integrate selective inclusion with the general-agent

6. **Implement adaptive context length**
   - Create a system to assess query complexity
   - Develop logic for adjusting context length based on complexity
   - Integrate adaptive context with the general-agent

## Phase 3: Long-Term Memory Enhancement

7. **Implement semantic embedding storage**
   - Set up a vector database (e.g., Chroma)
   - Develop system for converting key points to embeddings
   - Create retrieval mechanism based on semantic similarity

8. **Develop knowledge graph system**
   - Design knowledge graph schema for entities and relationships
   - Implement logic for constructing graph from conversations
   - Create system for querying and updating the knowledge graph

9. **Implement user profiles**
   - Design user profile schema
   - Develop logic for updating profiles based on interactions
   - Integrate user profiles with response generation

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

10. **Implement cross-session continuity**
    - Develop system for identifying and linking related sessions
    - Create mechanism for summarizing relevant past interactions
    - Integrate cross-session information into conversation start

11. **Develop memory confidence and temporal awareness**
    - Implement confidence scoring for stored memories
    - Add temporal tagging to all stored information
    - Integrate confidence and temporal data in memory retrieval

12. **Create controlled forgetting mechanism**
    - Develop algorithm for assessing information relevance over time
    - Implement gradual phasing out of outdated information
    - Ensure important core knowledge is preserved

## Phase 5: Integration and Optimization

13. **Refine and optimize background processes**
    - Improve efficiency of background summarization and refinement
    - Implement parallel processing for memory management tasks
    - Optimize database queries and vector searches

14. **Enhance general-agent integration**
    - Fully integrate all new systems with the general-agent
    - Implement seamless switching between different memory systems
    - Optimize response time while utilizing enhanced memory

15. **Implement comprehensive testing suite**
    - Develop unit tests for each new component
    - Create integration tests for the entire system
    - Implement performance benchmarks for memory and context management

## Phase 6: User Experience and Fine-tuning

16. **Develop user commands for memory management**
    - Implement commands for users to guide forgetting or focus
    - Create system for users to tag important information
    - Develop user-friendly interface for memory interaction

17. **Fine-tune the entire system**
    - Conduct extensive testing with various conversation scenarios
    - Adjust parameters for optimal balance of memory vs. performance
    - Implement A/B testing for different memory management strategies

18. **Document and finalize**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for all new systems
    - Develop user guide for interacting with memory-enhanced agent
    - Prepare final report on system architecture and performance

Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for testing and validation at each step. This plan ensures that we can incrementally enhance the general-agent's capabilities while maintaining a testable and stable system throughout the development process.
